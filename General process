# Cause Detection for Increase in Traffic Accidents

## Overview

This repository contains the code and documentation for analyzing the increase in traffic accidents and detecting the underlying causes. The project utilizes a Random Forest classifier for initial modeling and semi-supervised learning techniques to leverage both labeled and unlabeled data, aiming to improve model performance and interpret the factors contributing to the rise in traffic accidents.

## Contents

- `data/`: Directory containing the datasets used in the analysis.
- `src/`: Directory containing the source code for data preprocessing, model training, and SHAP analysis.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks demonstrating the data analysis, model development, and SHAP interpretation steps.
- `results/`: Directory to store the results of the analysis, including visualizations and reports.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/cause-detection-traffic-accidents.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd cause-detection-traffic-accidents
   ```

3. Set up the Python environment:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

### 1. Data Preparation

- Ensure the availability of relevant datasets in the `data/` directory.
- Preprocess the data, handling missing values and engineering features.

### 2. Model Training with Random Forest

- Train an initial Random Forest classifier using labeled data.
- Implement semi-supervised learning techniques to incorporate unlabeled data and enhance model performance.

### 3. SHAP Analysis

- Employ SHAP to interpret the predictions of the trained Random Forest model.
- Analyze feature importance and visualize global and local feature contributions to predictions.

### 4. Interpretation and Reporting

- Analyze SHAP results to interpret the factors driving the increase in traffic accidents.
- Generate comprehensive reports, visualizations, and insights for effective communication and recommendation.
